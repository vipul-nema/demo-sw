        Next, we use the ServiceWorkerContainer.register() function to register the service worker for this site, which is just a JavaScript file residing inside our app (note this is the file's URL
        relative to the origin, not the JS file that references it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service worker will now control pages, but only those opened after the register() is successful. i.e. a document starts life with or without a Service worker and maintains that for its
        lifetime. So documents will have to be reloaded to actually be controlled.
